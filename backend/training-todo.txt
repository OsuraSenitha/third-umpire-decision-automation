augment the color of wickets to give red and other colors
comments: cannot detect when the batsman is covered with someone (dataset dose not cover the situation)
            If the crease is not detected between the batsman and the wicket, the system will consider that the batsman has passed
            If the batsman overlaps the wicket horizontally, the system will consider that the batsman has passed
            the crease must be tilted between -15 to 15 degrees in the image
